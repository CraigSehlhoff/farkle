HEY! So this is my attempt at making a farkle game with Next.js. At the moment it is still a very early build of the game but it is playable. If you come across any bugs or issues please let me know either on GitHub or via email at myvirtualsobriety@gmail.com. Please be on the lookout for some updates soon!
-better styling
-customizable names
-ability to play online
-probably some more stuff!
